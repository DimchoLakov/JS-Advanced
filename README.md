In the "JS Advanced" course you will gain in-depth knowledge of the JavaScript language, such as syntax basics, working with arrays, matrices, objects, classes, and writing functions. You will study more complex concepts such as function context, explicit binding, event loop. The course will develop your algorithmic thinking. After the successful completion of this course, you will have the opportunity to work with the DOM tree, to manipulate it and to work with "events".
